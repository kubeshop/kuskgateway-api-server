# Kusk Gateway API Server

The REST API used by the [Kusk Dashboard](https://github.com/kubeshop/kusk-gateway-dashboard).

See [OpenAPI Definition](./api/openapi.yaml) for available operations if you want to provide an integration.

The Kusk CLI install command installs this together with the dashboard - see [Kusk Gateway Installation](https://kubeshop.github.io/kusk-gateway/cli/install-cmd/).
